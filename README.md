# CUDA and GPU Optimization of Material Point Method

MPM is a hybrid Eulerian/Lagrangian method for the simulation of physically accurate materials. In this project, we show off the compute capabilities of CUDA to implement a MPM simulator allowing for the real-time simulation of 200k particles for fluids of various viscosity.
